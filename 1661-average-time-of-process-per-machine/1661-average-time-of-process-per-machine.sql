-- if i don't write On s.machine_id = e.machine_id it means that machine_id can be anything it only checks process_id 

SELECT s.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp - s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity s JOIN Activity e 
ON s.machine_id = e.machine_id AND s.process_id = e.process_id AND s.activity_type = 'start' AND e.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY machine_id;
